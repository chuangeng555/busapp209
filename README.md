# busapp209
Bus app for Singaporeans
You can try the bot at telegram : @bus_209_bot

This repo contains: 

1. App.py -- Where the main bot run 
2. Config.py -- For setting up sensitive password / information configuration 
3. mod.py -- API request to aid App.py
4. Procfile -- Instruction for Heroku to run my App.py 
5. requirements.txt - libraires / modules / packages to download  


This is my first ever self-project, doing this for fun!
The bot is a-ok to run but if you got any idea how to make it faster, please get in touch with me :) !


p.s. I had to clear all existing commit history as it contains sensitive data :( , for those new with github, please learn how to set up environment variables / configuration if you have any sensitive data that you app must use to run
